# Summary
Datapot is a data generation tool. It can be used to generate huge volumes of test data that statistically matches production data. The idea is you can get data distributions parameters (e.g. number of encounters per patient, set of problem codes used, etc.) from a specific production site, and then use that data to configure Datapot. Datapot will then produce data as requested.

Please note that this is a cut-down version of the Datapot, put here for demonstration purposes only.
